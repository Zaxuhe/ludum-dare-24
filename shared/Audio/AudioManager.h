/**
 * Audio manager handles the playing of audio.
 *
 * The \c AudioManager plays two kinds of audio files: music and sounds.
 * Music is meant for background music and such audio that plays possibly
 * for a long time. Sounds are meant for audio that usually play only for
 * a short time like sound effects. There can always be a maximum of one
 * music file playing simultaneously. There is no hard limit on how many
 * sounds can be playing simultaneously but the underlaying audio backend
 * may put some limit to this.
 *
 * The music and sound playing systems can be disabled and enabled
 * independently from each other.
 *
 * The actual \c AudioManager class works as a general interface for audio
 * managers. The \c AudioManager class by itself produces no sound
 * whatsoever (so it can be used to disable sound completely if instantiated
 * directly). In order to produce any audible sound use one of the backend
 * specific audio managers.
 *
 * \see AudioManagerAndroid, AudioManagerAudiere, AudioManagerBBX,
 * AudioManagerDenshion, AudioManagerFMOD, AudioManagerOS, AudioManagerSDL
